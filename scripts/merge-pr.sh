# merge-pr.sh <PR_NUMBER> — the only way this repo's own agent should merge
# a PR once .claude/hooks/merge-gate-check.sh redirects a bare `gh pr merge`
# here. Repo-local only (not shipped — see CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md's CI
# Feedback Loop section and ROADMAP.md for why).
#
# What this mechanically proves (hard-verified, fail-closed):
#   - CI's `validate` check is success for the PR's REMOTE head SHA (not a
#     cached field — queried fresh every run).
#   - The PR touches no HARD_DENY path — the merge-evidence chain, including
#     this wrapper and its redirect hook themselves (closes the
#     self-referential loophole both Codex and a fresh Fable subagent
#     independently flagged in the original prose-only policy: a PR editing
#     the merge policy/mechanism wasn't excluded by a release-only list) —
#     UNLESS --dual-certified or --user-approved cleared it. Read a clean exit
#     as "no HARD path went uncleared", never as "no HARD path was touched";
#     the success line names which authority applied. Same correction the
#     ACKABLE bullet below already carries (Codex round-2 P2), applied here
#     before it could become false a second time.
#   - Every ACKABLE_DENY path the PR touches carries qualifying, SHA-bound
#     cross-model evidence. NOTE this is deliberately weaker than "touches no
#     denylist at all": a successful --cross-model-cleared run IS allowed to
#     touch the policy-prose files, and logs DENYLIST ACKNOWLEDGED when it
#     does. An auditor reading this contract must not read a clean exit as
#     "no denylisted path was touched" (Codex round-2 P2 — the earlier
#     wording asserted exactly that, and became false when tiering landed).
#   - The PR doesn't net-delete files under tests/.
#   - A per-PR clearance artifact exists, is CERTIFIED, references a round
#     >= 2 dialogue (a round-1-only CERTIFIED is treated as suspicious — see
#     below), is bound to the current remote head SHA (not stale), and
#     points at a non-empty review artifact.
#   - The merge itself is atomically bound to the SHA just checked via
#     `--match-head-commit`, closing the TOCTOU race between the checks
#     above and the actual merge (GitHub rejects the merge if HEAD moved).
#
# What stays fundamentally trust-based, even after all of the above (state
# this honestly, don't oversell it): "Codex reached CERTIFIED via a genuine
# adversarial dialogue" and "the Fable subagent was truly fresh/diff-only"
# can never be confirmed by a local script — an agent willing to forge the
# clearance artifact could equally forge a clearance comment. round >= 2 plus a
# non-empty review file is the best available proxy that review wasn't
# skipped or stale, not proof it wasn't faked. Real fake-resistance needs a
# server-side required check (tracked as a Research Parking Lot row in
# ROADMAP.md, not built here). This is a fast local gate against an honest
# agent under time pressure, not a security boundary against a determined
# adversary.

# --- THE REPOSITORY AND HOST THIS GATE ACTS ON ARE PINNED HERE ---
#
# #607 round 3: repository selection in this script was AMBIENT. gh honours
# GH_REPO and GH_HOST, git honours GIT_DIR and GIT_WORK_TREE, and `cd` binds
# neither. The reviewer demonstrated it by running it — with GIT_DIR pointed
# elsewhere, every check below reported success while the requests resolved to
# an unrelated repository. A gate that can be aimed at another repository is
# not a gate.
#
# These exports override whatever the CALLER set. Verified by execution
# against real gh 2.92.0 and real github.com: with GH_HOST=example.invalid,
# GH_REPO=example.invalid/evil/wrong and GIT_DIR=/tmp/nope.git in the parent
# environment, requests still reached Host: api.github.com and this
# repository, including from a call carrying no per-call flags at all.
#
# WHAT THAT DOES AND DOES NOT ESTABLISH — this comment claimed more than was
# true for two rounds, so it is now written narrowly on purpose:
#
#   * It pins calls that do not override it. It is NOT a guarantee about
#     "every present and future invocation". An inline `GH_REPO=x gh …`, a
#     per-call `-R` or `--hostname`, or a literal owner/repo in an API path
#     all take precedence over these lines. Each of those was demonstrated.
#   * It pins the INITIAL request URL. `--paginate` follows the absolute URL
#     a server returns in its Link header and uses it directly, so a server
#     returning a cross-host Link would send the follow-up request there
#     regardless of GH_HOST or --hostname.
#   * BOTH LINES ARE LOAD-BEARING. GH_REPO takes a HOST/OWNER/REPO form and
#     looks like it pins the host too. It does not: with GH_REPO set correctly
#     and a hostile GH_HOST, the request went to Host: example.invalid on the
#     /api/v3/ enterprise path. GH_HOST wins and must be pinned separately.
#
# The per-call `-R` and `--hostname github.com` flags below are kept as a
# second layer. NOT VERIFIED, and previously asserted here as though it were:
# that either layer independently survives deletion of the other at all ten
# call sites. Only the merge call has its exact argv asserted by the suite,
# and the exports were only ever observed as environment values. Treat the two
# layers as belt and braces, not as two independently proven guarantees.
#
# NOT CLOSED BY THIS: GIT_DIR still redirects this script's own `git` calls —
# optionally paired with GIT_WORK_TREE, though GIT_WORK_TREE ALONE does not,
# since it leaves this repository's .git and its origin/main resolution
# intact. Those calls are load-bearing for the self-integrity byte-match and
# for clearance tree binding. Separate channel from gh's, tracked in #681.
#
# There is no test in this repo that proves the pin holds for a call added
# later. Four were written and all four were deleted for reporting a property
# they did not check — see the long note in tests/test-merge-gate.sh.

# --- Two tiers (ROADMAP #479). Codex xhigh (96%) and Fable xhigh (85%),
# consulted independently and blind to each other, both recommended this split.
#
# HARD_DENY is the MERGE-EVIDENCE CHAIN: paths where a PR can alter the meaning
# of the evidence used to merge it. On these, every leg of the evidence stack
# becomes the agent's own say-so simultaneously — branch protection requires the
# check by NAME, so ANY new file under .github/workflows/ can mint a green
# "validate"; the gate that runs is the PR's own working-tree gate; and both
# clearance comments come from the same gh token. Errors in the control plane
# compound, errors in the data plane do not. --cross-model-cleared CANNOT
# satisfy these.
#
# GH #511 — --dual-certified CAN, under a strictly higher bar. The maintainer
# stated it as standing policy: two models that did not write the code, run blind
# to each other, each able to refuse, is a categorically different evidence class
# from "the author says it is fine". Until this flag existed the only way to say
# yes here was --user-approved, so every such merge recorded a per-PR human
# decision for what was actually one standing policy decision — the mechanism was
# forcing a framing lie into the very records that exist to explain why something
# merged.
#
# Two of the three self-produced legs above are answered directly:
#   - "the gate that runs is the PR's own working-tree gate" — the dual path
#     refuses unless this script and its redirect hook byte-match origin/main.
#   - "clearance is a local file the agent wrote" — the dual path additionally
#     requires two distinct reviewers' visible, SHA-bound YES comments on the PR,
#     and does NOT waive the clearance artifact (so round >= 2 still holds).
# The third — a new .github/workflows/ file minting a green "validate" — is NOT
# closed. Nothing local can close it; the compensating layer is that both
# reviewers read that file in the diff. Say so, do not imply otherwise.

# Deliberately NOT denylisted:
#   CHANGELOG.md — both reviewers measured it as dead weight: across the last

#     which the unconditional content check below already blocks.
#   '^\.github/workflows/release' — redundant now that all of
#     .github/workflows/ is hard-denied.
# package.json is checked for its VERSION FIELD specifically, not any touch (a
# dependency bump shouldn't be release-adjacent) — a content diff below, not a
# path pattern, and unconditional in both tiers.
#
# hooks/ granularity: Fable argued a narrower core (only review-evidence hooks
# hard, advisory ones ackable — 15% vs 26% of PRs needing a human) but said
# plainly that the broad directory is the zero-cleverness option. Broad is used
# here: "advisory vs evidence" is a judgement that drifts as hooks change, and
# it matches the guidance already recorded in ROADMAP #478.

# --- Cross-model clearance, read from the REMOTE PR (ROADMAP #479) ---
#
# WHAT THIS IS, STATED HONESTLY (corrected after Codex round 1):
# This is an AUDIT TRAIL, not an authentication boundary. An earlier version of
# this comment claimed PR comments are harder to forge than a local artifact
# because they are "timestamped, attributable, SHA-bound". Attributable was
# never true: the parser discarded the comment's author. Worse, binding to the
# author does not rescue the claim here, because both reviews are posted by the
# SAME gh token — there is no second authenticated principal to tell them apart.
#
# What it does give you: evidence that is durable, timestamped, readable by a
# human long afterwards, and invalidated by any new push. Against the stated
# threat model — an honest agent that is degraded or under time pressure — that
# is worth having. Against a determined agent it is not, and nothing here
# should be read as claiming otherwise.
#
# Requires: at least two DISTINCT reviewers, each at confidence >= 95 (integer
# 0..100), each bound to the exact head SHA. The author login of each comment
# is recorded in the output so an auditor can see who actually posted it.

        #

        # carrying `verdict` twice — NO first, YES last — parsed as YES and
        # merged while the rendered comment read as a refusal. I answered by
        # counting `"verdict":` in the raw text.

        # so the raw-text count saw one key and the parser saw two. Counting
        # literal text cannot win against escaping — every escape form I block,
        # another encodes around.
        #
        # So this stops counting and pins the payload instead: EXACTLY the four
