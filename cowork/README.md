# SDLC Harness — Cowork Plugin

## The Shallow Surface — By Design

This project's primary target is **Claude Code (CLI)**. Cowork support is a bonus surface
and will never hold the CLI back. What ships here is deliberately the shallow version.

**You get:** the complete `/sdlc` operational checklist — byte-identical to the CLI skill,
nothing removed — plus the `/feedback` skill and one best-effort prompt hook.

**You do not get:**

- **`CLAUDE_CODE_SDLC_WIZARD.md`** (the ~291 KB deep-protocol doc). The skill cites it for
  optional depth; in Cowork those citations are inert. The checklist is the complete
  contract on its own, and the skill says so at the top.
- Setup/update skills, shell hooks, the CLI installer, or cross-model review tooling.
- **Enforcement.** Live testing (GH #456) found the prompt hooks do not reliably gate. The
  completion hook was removed in v1.92.0 after firing 12 times and being wrong 11, and the
  prompt classifier in v1.97.0 (GH #561) after denying the maintainer's own instructions
  twice. The one remaining hook is a nudge with **no enforcement guarantee** — treat
  enforcement as unproven, not merely absent.

**If you have a terminal, use the full wizard:** `npx agentic-sdlc-wizard init`.

**Why this is not forked into a Cowork-specific skill.** The skill is byte-identical across
both surfaces, enforced by `tests/test-cowork-drift.sh`. Two hand-maintained copies of a
20 KB operational contract would silently diverge — this repo's most reliable source of
defects — to fix pointers that are inert text here anyway.

## What You Get

| Component | Invocation / Event | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| SDLC skill | `/sdlc-wizard-cowork:sdlc` | Full SDLC workflow: planning, TDD, self-review |
| Feedback skill | `/sdlc-wizard-cowork:feedback` | Privacy-first community feedback and pattern sharing |
| TDD hook | `PreToolUse` (Write/Edit) | Denies creating a new non-test file that doesn't look like a test (filename heuristic — see limits below) |
| ~~Completion hook~~ | ~~`Stop`~~ | **REMOVED in v1.92.0 (GH #484).** It fired 12 times in one session and was wrong 11 — blocking turns that changed no files, turns already verified, and repeatedly overriding its own stated exemptions. A `Stop` hook fires at the end of *every* turn, so a blocking one interrupts constantly. There is now **no completion enforcement in Cowork**; see the honesty note below. |

## Hooks — Prompt-Based Enforcement

This plugin ships 1 **prompt-based hook** (`"type": "prompt"`) — a narrow slice of SDLC discipline, without shell access. The `Stop` (completion) hook was removed in v1.92.0 (GH #484) and the `UserPromptSubmit` hook in v1.97.0 (GH #561).

| Cowork Hook | Claude Code Equivalent | Event |
|-------------|----------------------|-------|
| TDD check | `tdd-pretool-check.sh` | `PreToolUse` (Write/Edit/MultiEdit) |


**Prompt hooks do not inject text into the main conversation.** Per Anthropic's documented `prompt` hook contract (`code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks`), each hook sends its `prompt` field to a separate, single-turn evaluator model (Haiku by default), with the hook's JSON input either substituted at `$ARGUMENTS` or auto-appended if `$ARGUMENTS` is omitted. The evaluator must respond `{"ok": true}` to allow, or `{"ok": false, "reason": "..."}` to deny — no shell, no filesystem access needed, but also no soft reminders: it's a real gate, not a nudge.

**Known limit:** the `PreToolUse` TDD check can only see the current file write, not prior turns or the filesystem — it's a best-effort filename heuristic (denies creating a new non-test file), not proof a failing test was actually run first. A `type: "agent"` hook (multi-turn, with Read/Grep/Glob access) would be the mechanically correct fix for real TDD-order verification; that's a larger, separate change, tracked as a follow-up rather than attempted here.

> **Note:** Live-tested via Codex Desktop computer-use E2E runs (issue [#432](https://github.com/BaseInfinity/claude-sdlc-harness/issues/432), 2026-07-19/20). An earlier version of these hooks was authored against an incorrect understanding of the mechanism (wrong response schema, checklist-style prompts with no explicit final decision request) — see [#456](https://github.com/BaseInfinity/claude-sdlc-harness/issues/456) — and has since been rewritten to match Anthropic's documented examples. If hooks still misbehave after install, file a bug on the [wizard repo](https://github.com/BaseInfinity/claude-sdlc-harness/issues).

### What's NOT Ported (and Why)

| Claude Code Hook | Why Not Ported |
|-----------------|----------------|
| `instructions-loaded-check.sh` | `InstructionsLoaded` event not available in Cowork plugin hooks |
| `model-effort-check.sh` | Effort levels are CC-specific; Cowork doesn't expose model config |
| `precompact-seam-check.sh` | Depends on `.git/` on disk (rebase/merge/cherry-pick state); Cowork may not have filesystem |

### What's NOT Included (and Why)

**No Setup or Update skills** — these are CLI-specific (read version markers, write hooks to `.claude/`, run shell commands). Use the full wizard via `npx agentic-sdlc-wizard init` in a Claude Code session.

**CLI-dependent SDLC sections** — the `/sdlc` skill references tools you may not have in Cowork:

- **Cross-model review** (`codex exec`) — use ChatGPT/Codex web manually as your cross-model check
- **CI shepherd** (`gh pr`, `git push`) — these steps happen outside your Cowork session
- **`/code-review`** — works in Cowork if the plugin is loaded

The methodology (plan → TDD → cross-model review → confidence check) is universal, and the skills describe all of it. **One hook remains, and it enforces very little** — do not read the table above as full enforcement. `PreToolUse` applies a filename heuristic to brand-new non-test files. That is the whole of it.

**There is no completion gate and no prompt gate.** The `Stop` hook was removed in v1.92.0 (GH #484) after scoring 11 false positives in 12 firings; the `UserPromptSubmit` classifier was removed in v1.97.0 (GH #561) after denying the maintainer's own instructions twice, the second time after a narrowing repair. Blocking hooks belong on ACTS, not on turn-level subject matter.

**The honest cost of that removal:** a prompt asking to skip planning or review, followed by edits to files that already exist, now hits no gate at all — `PreToolUse` fails open for edits, and the CLI's commit and merge gates cannot run in Cowork, which has no shell. Everything else is guidance you follow, not a gate that stops you.

## Installation

### From GitHub (recommended)

The plugin lives in a subdirectory of the main wizard repo, so it's registered as a second entry (`sdlc-wizard-cowork`) in the repo's root marketplace via a `git-subdir` source — a GitHub web-UI URL like `.../tree/main/cowork` is **not** a supported marketplace source on its own (only `owner/repo` shorthand, full git URLs, local paths, or direct `marketplace.json` URLs are). Add the whole repo as a marketplace, then install the Cowork-specific plugin from it:

```
/plugin marketplace add BaseInfinity/claude-sdlc-harness
/plugin install sdlc-wizard-cowork@sdlc-wizard-marketplace
```

In Claude Desktop's UI, this is Customize > Plugins > Add marketplace, entering `BaseInfinity/claude-sdlc-harness`, then selecting `sdlc-wizard-cowork` from the marketplace's plugin list (not the top-level `sdlc-wizard` entry, which is the CLI-based full wizard).

**Fallback (local ZIP upload):** if the marketplace/install flow isn't available in your Claude Desktop build, zip this `cowork/` directory (root must contain `.claude-plugin/`, `hooks/`, `skills/`, `README.md`) and use Customize > Plugins > Add plugin > Upload plugin instead.

### Updating an installed plugin

**Cowork Desktop:** update through the same plugin UI you installed from (Customize > Plugins). **This path is not yet verified end-to-end** — tracked in GH #571. The commands below apply only to Claude Code CLI installs.

**Claude Code CLI.** The step observed to actually move an installed plugin to a new version is `/reload-plugins`, run inside a session — it took this plugin from 1.93.0 to 1.97.0 and `Hooks (2)` to `Hooks (1)`.

There is also a CLI command, and **it needs the marketplace-qualified identifier**. The bare plugin name fails:

```
$ claude plugin update sdlc-wizard-cowork
✘ Failed to update plugin "sdlc-wizard-cowork": Plugin "sdlc-wizard-cowork" not found

$ claude plugin update sdlc-wizard-cowork@sdlc-wizard-marketplace
✔ sdlc-wizard-cowork is already at the latest version (1.97.0).
```

`--scope user` does not help; the qualified form is what resolves. Both observed on Claude Code 2.1.221. Note what the second line does and does not prove: the identifier **resolves**. It was run against an already-current install, so **this command has not been observed performing an actual version change** — only `/reload-plugins` has. The CLI's help says "restart required to apply," so restart the session after it either way.

Then verify — do not assume:

```
claude plugin details sdlc-wizard-cowork
```

The version is in the **header line**, not on a labelled field — `details` prints `sdlc-wizard-cowork 1.97.0` and has no `Version:` line at all (that label belongs to `claude plugin list`). Check that header and the full expected component set. As of v1.97.0 that is `1.97.0` and `Hooks (1)  PreToolUse`. If it still reports `Hooks (2)`, you are on an older build and the update did not apply.

**One command looks like it updates the plugin and does not.** `claude plugin marketplace update <marketplace>` prints `✔ Successfully updated marketplace` but refreshes the **catalog** only — the installed plugin stays where it was. `claude plugin disable` / `enable` also print success without re-resolving. All three observed on Claude Code 2.1.221. Verifying afterwards is the only way to know an update actually landed.

### Local testing

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./cowork
```

## Relationship to the Full Wizard

This is a **subset** of the [SDLC Harness](https://github.com/BaseInfinity/claude-sdlc-harness). The full wizard provides:

- 6 lifecycle hooks (command-based, bash)
- 4 skills (sdlc, setup, update, feedback)
- CLI installer (`npx agentic-sdlc-wizard init`)
- npm package distribution

This Cowork plugin provides 2 portable skills + 1 prompt-based hook — a narrow slice of enforcement without shell access.

### Drift Prevention

The skills in this package are **copies** of the canonical skills in `skills/`. A CI test (`tests/test-cowork-drift.sh`) fails if they diverge. The test also validates hook format (prompt-only, correct events, valid JSON). When the canonical skills update, the test forces this package to sync.

## For Claude Code Users

If you have terminal access, use the full wizard instead:

```bash
npx agentic-sdlc-wizard init
```

This plugin is for Cowork-only users who want methodology guidance without the full CLI setup.
