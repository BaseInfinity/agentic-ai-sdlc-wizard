# ROADMAP #479: maintainer *approval* and safety-check *bypass* were the same
# lever. `MERGE_CLEARANCE_SKIP=1` was the only way past a denylist hit, and it
# also disabled the CI check, the test-deletion check, the head-SHA freshness
# check and the clearance-artifact check — so acknowledging one red row meant
# disarming four green ones. It was also unusable by an agent: Claude Code's
# auto-mode classifier denies it as a safeguard bypass, by design.
#
# This replaces it with `--cross-model-cleared`, which satisfies the DENYLIST
# FINDING ONLY. Every other check stays mandatory and fail-closed.
#
# WHAT THIS IS — corrected after review, having first been overstated here.
# The original version of this comment claimed the evidence is "EXTERNALLY
# VERIFIABLE ... timestamped, attributable, SHA-bound" and therefore harder to
# forge than a local artifact. Codex disproved *attributable* by execution: the
# author was discarded, so the reviewer identity was a self-declared string, and
# one account posted two comments claiming to be two different models. Binding
# to the author does not rescue it either — both reviews come from the same `gh`
# token, so there is no second authenticated principal.
#
# The honest claim is narrower: this is an AUDIT TRAIL, not an authentication
# boundary. It is durable, timestamped, visibly rendered, and invalidated by any
# new push. It does NOT prove two models ran. The genuinely load-bearing win is
# the SCOPE fix — the acknowledgement no longer disarms CI, test-deletion,
# SHA-freshness or the clearance artifact, which was #479's actual defect.
#
# Required shape of a clearance comment on the PR (the marker is deliberately
# VISIBLE — an HTML-comment marker let the whole payload be hidden from the
# human the audit trail exists for):
#
#   **CROSS-MODEL-CLEARANCE**
#   ```json
#   {"reviewer":"codex-gpt-5.6-sol","confidence":100,"sha":"<40 hex>"}
#   ```
#
# Merge is permitted past a denylist hit only when at least two DISTINCT
# reviewers have posted such a comment, each at confidence >= 95, each bound to
# the exact head SHA being merged. Pushing a new commit invalidates clearance.
#
# Per ROADMAP #482, every assertion below checks the EXIT CODE, not a grepped
# message string: message text drifts, and an assertion that only greps prose
# passes vacuously the moment the wording changes.

# agent must not be able to self-clear the merge-EVIDENCE CHAIN. On those paths
# every leg of the evidence stack becomes the agent's own say-so at once —
# `validate` is defined by the PR (branch protection requires the check by NAME,
# so any new workflow file can mint one), the gate that runs is the PR's own
# gate, and both clearance comments are posted by the same token. Errors in the
# control plane compound; errors in the data plane do not.
