# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE GATE'S REPOSITORY AND HOST ARE PINNED BY CONSTRUCTION, AND THESE ROWS
# CHECK THAT — THEY DO NOT PARSE SHELL.
#
# #607 round 3. Repository selection was AMBIENT: gh honours GH_REPO/GH_HOST
# and git honours GIT_DIR/GIT_WORK_TREE, and `cd` binds neither. The reviewer
# demonstrated it by running it — with GIT_DIR pointed elsewhere, every check
# reported success while the request resolved to an unrelated repository.
#
# TWO ROUNDS OF REVIEW WERE SPENT ON THE WRONG SHAPE OF GUARD, and the second
# round's defect was created by the first round's fix. That is worth recording
# because it is the same signature that got #607's wrapper ruled WRONG_SHAPE.
#
#   Round 1 guarded by grepping for three fixed call prefixes and treating the
#   substring `-R ` anywhere on the line as proof of a pin. It passed an
#   unpinned call whose only `-R` sat in a trailing comment, and it could not
#   see pipeline, backtick, direct or wrapped invocations at all.
#
#   Round 2 replaced that with a preprocessor: blank single-quoted strings,
#   then double-quoted strings, then comments, and treat whatever `gh` survived
#   as a real invocation. Round 2's review falsified it by execution. The line
#   `X="$(gh pr list --state open)"` — an ordinary form — is erased ENTIRELY,
#   because the command substitution sits inside the double quotes that get
#   blanked. The call becomes invisible, and the count row added to catch
#   exactly that cannot: an erased addition does not change the count.
#
# Both failures are the same failure. A text heuristic that errs toward
# false-PASS is not a guard, it is a report that nothing was examined. So the
# per-call-site policing is gone, and the property is held by construction
# instead:
#
#     export GH_HOST=github.com
#     export GH_REPO=BaseInfinity/claude-sdlc-harness
#
# The script's own exports beat the caller's environment, so EVERY gh call —
# present, future, and in whatever syntactic form a scanner could not parse —
# resolves to this repository on this host. Verified by execution under a
# hostile outer environment, real gh 2.92.0, real network: with
# GH_HOST=example.invalid GH_REPO=example.invalid/evil/wrong GIT_DIR=/tmp/nope.git
# in the parent, the request still went to `Host: api.github.com` and returned
# this repository's real ref.
#
# BOTH EXPORTS ARE LOAD-BEARING and that is not obvious. GH_REPO accepts a
# HOST/OWNER/REPO form, so it looks like it should pin the host too. It does
# not: with GH_REPO set correctly and a hostile GH_HOST, the request went to
# `Host: example.invalid` on the `/api/v3/` enterprise path. GH_HOST wins.
#
# The per-call `-R` and `--hostname` flags stay in place as defense in depth.
# Each layer covers a refactor that deletes the other.
#
# What remains below checks only things that can be read literally: two export
# lines, a banned set of placeholder tokens, and a required literal path. Each
# errs toward false-FAIL — a stray `:owner` in a trailing comment trips row 2,
# which is a loud nuisance rather than a silent pass.

# merge-pr.sh must not overstate it.

# Args are passed through as SEPARATE PARAMETERS, never as one string. An
# earlier version took a single string and word-split it unquoted, so

# The maintainer stated it as standing policy: "if fable and codex agree with the

# "a human decides" and the only way to say yes was --user-approved, so every
# merge on 2026-08-07/08 recorded a per-PR human decision that had actually been
# made once, months earlier, as policy. The mechanism was forcing a framing lie
# into the audit trail — worse than an inconvenience, because these records are
# the durable evidence of WHY something merged.
#
# What makes this different from self-review, and therefore admissible where
# --cross-model-cleared is not: two models that did not write the code, run blind
# to each other, each able to refuse. PR #497 took five rounds before both
# certified and every round found real defects.
